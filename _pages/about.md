I am a Research Associate and an Algorithm Specialist with the Department of Information Center, Fuwai Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College. I recieved my Ph.D. degree in Statistics from Renmin University of China in 2021.

My research area is in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Specific topics include tensor learning, nonlinear regression, self-supervised learning, and foundation models.

I am also a practitioner in Artificial Intelligence. I have developed an assisted diagnosis AI product that has been deployed in the hospital.
