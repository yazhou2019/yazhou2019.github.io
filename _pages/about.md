I am a Research Associate and an Algorithm Specialist with the Department of Information Center, Fuwai Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College. Prior to that, I received a B.A. in Statistics from Sichuan University in 2016, an M.S. in Statistics from Texas A&M University in 2019, and a Ph.D. in Statistics from Renmin University of China in 2021 (Advisors: [Kejun He](http://isbd.ruc.edu.cn/sztd/c649d51f7a9d4557b25db81b705037e1.htm), [Raymond Wong](https://raymondkww.github.io))

My research area is in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Specific topics include tensor learning, nonlinear regression, self-supervised learning, and foundation models.

I am also a practitioner in Artificial Intelligence. I have developed an assisted diagnosis AI product that has been deployed in the hospital.
