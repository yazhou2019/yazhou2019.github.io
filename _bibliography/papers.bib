	abstract={Electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most important diagnostic tools in clinical applications. With the advent of advanced algorithms, various deep learning models have been adopted for ECG tasks. However, the potential of Transformers for ECG data is not yet realized, despite their widespread success in computer vision and natural language processing. In this work, we present a useful masked Transformer method for ECG classification referred to as MTECG, which expands the application of masked
	autoencoders to ECG time series. We construct a dataset comprising 220,251 ECG recordings with a broad range of diagnoses annoated by medical experts to explore the properties of MTECG. Under the proposed training strategies, a lightweight model with 5.7M parameters performs stably well on a broad range of masking ratios (5%-75%). The ablation studies highlight the importance of fluctuated reconstruction targets, training schedule length, layer-wise LR decay and DropPath rate. The experiments on both private and public ECG datasets demonstrate that MTECG-T significantly outperforms the recent state-of-the-art algorithms in ECG classification.}

	abstract={Multivariate varying-coefficient models (MVCM) are popular statistical tools for analyzing the relationship between multiple responses and covariates. Nevertheless, estimating large numbers of coefficient functions is challenging, especially with a limited amount of samples. In this work, we propose a reduced- dimension model based on the Tucker decomposition, which unifies several existing models. In addition, sparse predictor effects, in the sense that only a few predictors are related to the responses, are exploited to achieve an interpretable model and sufficiently reduce the number of unknown functions to be estimated. All the above dimension-reduction and sparsity considerations are integrated into a penalized least squares problem on the constraint domain of 3rd-order tensors. To compute the proposed estimator, we propose a block updating algorithm with ADMM and manifold optimization. We also establish the oracle inequality for the prediction risk of the proposed estimator. A real data set from Framingham Heart Study is used to demonstrate the good predictive performance of the proposed method.}

A penalized estimation and the corresponding algorithm are proposed. Our theoretical investigation, which allows the dimensions of the tensor covariate to diverge, indicates that the proposed estimation yields a desirable convergence rate. We also provide a minimax lower bound, which characterizes the optimality of the proposed estimator for a wide range of scenarios. Numerical experiments are conducted to confirm the theoretical findings, and they show that the proposed model has advantages over its existing linear counterparts.},

	abstract={Tensor regression is an important and useful tool for analyzing multidimensional array data. To deal with high dimensionality, CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) low-rank constraints are often imposed on the coefficient tensor parameter in the (penalized) loss functions. However, besides the well-known non-identifiability issue of the CP parameters, we demonstrate that the corresponding optimization may not have any attainable solutions, and thus the estimation of the coefficient tensor is not well-defined when this happens. This is closely related to a phenomenon, called CP degeneracy, in low-rank tensor approximation problems. In this article, we show some useful results of CP degeneracy in the context of tensor regression problems. To overcome the theoretical and numerical issues associated with the degeneracy, we provide a general penalized strategy as a solution to the degeneracy. The related results also explain why some of the existing methods are more stable than the others. The asymptotic properties of the resulting estimation are also studied. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate our findings.}

	abstract={Many applications of regression study the predictors with complex forms such as tensors. Besides low dimensional assumption, the effects of predictors with a tensor structure typically show clustered or smooth phenomena in the sense that adjacent elements have a similar effect on the response. To simultaneously incorporate the low-rank and smoothness in tensor regression, we generalize the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition to a smooth version and propose a novel regression model based on the smoothed decomposition. The asymptotic theory of the proposed method is studied, which shows a faster rate of convergence than the one without incorporating the smoothness. The experiments on both synthetic and real data confirm that the proposed method has advantages over the alternative especially when the sample size is small.}
